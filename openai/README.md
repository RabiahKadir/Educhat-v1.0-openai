# OpenAI Chatbot with gpt-3.5-turbo model

This is a simple chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo language model to generate responses to user input.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kydycode/chatgpt-3.5-turbo.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up an OpenAI API key by following the instructions [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
4. Add your API key to the `YOUR_API_KEY` field in `main.py`

## Usage

To start the chatbot, run `main.py` using Python 3:

    python main.py


The chatbot will prompt you to enter your input, and then it will generate a response using the GPT-3 model. The conversation history is stored in a list of dictionaries called `message_log`.

To end the chatbot, type "quit" at any time.
